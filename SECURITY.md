# libwebauthn Security Policy

Since this project handles very sensitive data, we, the maintainers of
libwebauthn, take security seriously. This policy outlines our intentions for
addressing security issues and practices for security researchers investigating
this project.

## Submitting Vulnerability Reports

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report it
to us privately via the process below.

We use GitHub for private vulnerability disclosure. To report a vulnerability:

1. Go to [Security > Advisories > New draft security advisory][new-advisory].
2. Fill out the report and submit the draft.
3. The maintainers will be privately notified about the advisory and get back to
   you.

## Expected Response

We aim to acknowledge the receipt of the report as soon as possible and will
work with you. We seek to investigate issues within 30 days.

If the issue is confirmed upon investigation, we will collaborate with you to
remediate the vulnerability. Depending on the severity or developer
availability, we may request more time to remediate the issue before
public disclosure.

# Supported Releases

We only support the latest published release. We may backport patches when
possible to help users running on distributions that package older versions of
our software.
